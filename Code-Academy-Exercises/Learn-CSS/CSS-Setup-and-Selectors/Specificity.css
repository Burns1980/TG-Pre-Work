/* A best practice in CSS is to style using the least degree of specificity where
specificity is the order in which the browser selects the CSS style to use. IDs are
the most specific, then classes, while tags are the least specific. Using the lowest
degree of specificity makes it easier to edit as the size of the file grows. */
