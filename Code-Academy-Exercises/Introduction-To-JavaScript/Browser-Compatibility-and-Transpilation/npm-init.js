/*
npm is a node package manager. It is used to manage node packages, which are directories with
js code written by other developers. This will be used to transpile ES6 to ES5. The npm init command
is used to add a package.json file to the root project directory (if you have Node installed on computer),
which is needed to use babel. The package.json file contains info about the current JavaScript project.
