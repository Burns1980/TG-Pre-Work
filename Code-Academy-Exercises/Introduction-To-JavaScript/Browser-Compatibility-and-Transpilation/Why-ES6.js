var pasta = "Spaghetti"; // ES5 syntax

var meat = "Pancetta"; // ES6 syntax

var sauce = "Eggs and cheese"; // ES6 syntax

// Template literals, like the one below, were introduced in ES6
var carbonara = "You can make carbonara with " + pasta + " " + meat ", and a sauce made with " + sauce ".";

//In ES5, the let and const kw were not yet used. Also, strings need to use + signs in between
//quotation marks to interpolate variables into strings.
