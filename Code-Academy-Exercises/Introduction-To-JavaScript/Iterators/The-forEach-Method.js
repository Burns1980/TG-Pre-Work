const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log("I want to eat a " + fruit));

//The forEach method is an iterator. It takes a function as an argument, performs that funtion to
//each element of the array. The return value is always undefined.
