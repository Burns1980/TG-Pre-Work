//Javascript modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported or exported.
//They are useful in separating code with similar logic into their own file.
//Modular coding makes it easier to find and fix bugs. Reuse code, keep info private
//and protected from other modules and prevent pollution of the global namespace.
